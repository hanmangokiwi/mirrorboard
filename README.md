# mirrorboard

For those who need one hand to do something while typing

I had this idea for a while now, making the first version in 2020, but of course, all original ideas have already been taken. So I stole the name from this [xkcd blog](https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/) by Randall.

In essence, this makes the caps lock key into a toggle, which mirrors the keyboard so if you type "qwerty", you get out "poiuyt".

Here is a nice diagram to show what is mapped to what:

Some code was stolen off various fourm posts and [Figaw's version of mirrorboard](https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/)

Extra feature ideas were inspired by [rfxDarth's implementation](https://github.com/rfxDarth/mirrorboard/blob/master/README.md)
