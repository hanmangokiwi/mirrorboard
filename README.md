# mirrorboard

For those who need one hand to do something while typing

I had this idea for a while now, making the first version in 2020, but of course, all original ideas have already been taken. So I stole the name from this [xkcd blog](https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/) by Randall.

In essence, this makes the caps lock key into a toggle, which mirrors the keyboard so if you type "qwerty" with caps lock activated, you get out "poiuyt".

# Installation
1. Download AutoHotkey from here:

2. Run mirrorboard.ahk
3. ???
4. Profit

You could throw mirrorboard.ahk in the startup folder if you want mirrorboard to be enabled at all times.


# Usage
Here is a nice diagram to show what is mapped to what:

Pressing the caps lock or the tray key (blue) switches between the normal and the mirrored layout. The keys that are colored light blue are the keys that are different from the normal layout.

Pressing space will type a space character and return the layout to normal.

Using your left hand, try typing "Hello, World!"  
(hint: type "He[caps]ssw [space] w[caps]o[caps]r[caps]s[caps]d!")  
If you make a mistake, the backspace key is mapped to ctrl. I usually press it with my palm.

To gain access to -__=+\|[]{} and the arrow keys, hold down alt and press the keys as shown on the diagram.

To gain access to the nine keys above the arrow keys, while holding down alt, hold down the windows key as well, then press the keys as shown in the diagram.

You may notice that the mirrored ++ and mirrored # only works if you are using your left hand. Thats because all those keys are already on the right side.

If you are going to learn mirrorboard, I advise you start with your left hand, because most typing is done with the left hand so it'll be easier to learn.

Some code was stolen off various fourm posts and [Figaw's version of mirrorboard](https://blog.xkcd.com/2007/08/14/mirrorboard-a-one-handed-keyboard-layout-for-the-lazy/)

Extra feature ideas were inspired by [rfxDarth's implementation](https://github.com/rfxDarth/mirrorboard/blob/master/README.md)
